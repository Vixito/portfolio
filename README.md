## 🎯 Why No AI Chatbot?

You might notice this portfolio doesn't include an AI chatbot or agent. **This was a conscious design decision, not a technical limitation.**

I specialize in backend and AI development, but for this project, I didn't see it as necessary. The portfolio isn't so immense that it requires an AI assistant to navigate. Sometimes the best technical decision is knowing when *not* to add complexity.
